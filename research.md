My main research is to understand HIV epidemics from statistical modelling. I'm also involved in some researches in Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team.  

## Current research highlight
# HIV
I developed [phyloflow](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/phyloscanner/tree/master/phyloflows) to adjust sampling heterogeneity and interpret transmission flows from deep sequence data. The package has been applied to several applications:
* Ratmann, O., Kagaayi, J., Hall, M., Golubchick, T., Kigozi, G., **Xi, X**., Wymant, C., Nakigozi, G., Abeler-Dörner, L., Bonsall, D. and Gall, A., 2020. Quantifying HIV transmission flow between high-prevalence hotspots and surrounding communities: a population-based study in Rakai, Uganda. The Lancet HIV, 7(3), pp.e173-e183.
* Bbosa, N., Ssemwanga, D., Ssekagiri, A., **Xi, X.**, Mayanja, Y., Bahemuka, U., Seeley, J., Pillay, D., Abeler-Dörner, L., Golubchik, T. and Fraser, C., 2020. Phylogenetic and demographic characterization of directed HIV-1 transmission using deep sequences from high-risk and general population cohorts/groups in Uganda. Viruses, 12(3), p.331.

# COVID-19
I mainly participated in the following COVID-19 researches (first author with equal contributions):
* Monod, M., Blenkinsop, A., **Xi, X.**, Hebert, D., Bershan, S., Tietze, S., Baguelin, M., Bradley, V.C., Chen, Y., Coupland, H. and Filippi, S., 2021. Age groups that sustain resurging COVID-19 epidemics in the United States. Science, 371(6536).
* Fu, H., Wang, H., **Xi, X.**, Boonyasiri, A., Wang, Y., Hinsley, W., Fraser, K.J., McCabe, R., Mesa, D.O., Skarp, J. and Ledda, A., 2021. Database of epidemic trends and control measures during the first wave of COVID-19 in mainland China. International Journal of Infectious Diseases, 102, pp.463-471.
